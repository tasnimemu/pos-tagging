This project explores [part-of-speech (POS) tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging), a standard task in natural language processing. The goal is to identify parts of speech and related labels for each word in a given corpus. HMMs are well suited for this problem, with parts of speech being hidden states and the words themselves being observations.

Data from the English EWT treebank from [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/treebanks/en_ewt/index.html), which uses 17 POS tags, will be used. This project works with clean versions of training and test data, and the data format is such that each line contains a word and associated tag and an empty line signifing the end of a sentence.
